Dear PCI RR editors,

Here I happily submit a preregistered draft manuscript called 'City of
Thieves solved'. I chose PCI RR as I have reviewed a manuscript for
them/you already [1], which was an excellent experience.

Although I think the methods are well described, I can imagine
a problem with the acceptance of this type of research: in the end,
it is just a research to solve a puzzle. Yet, in the end, that is what
pre-registration is about: to review the method and analysis. Hence,
here I submit this draft optimistically. 

The frozen pre-registration can be found at https://osf.io/7j5fc , 
yet do use the PDF called 'article.pdf' under Files: it looks 
quite a bit better :-)

Thanks and cheers, Richel Bilderbeek
